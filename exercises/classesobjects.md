#### 4. Kitten

Write a method called `makeKitten` that takes 2 Cats as parameters
 and returns a new Cat with a name that is the combination of the 2
 parent Cats' names. The age of the new Cat should be `0`.

```
ex: makeKitten(garfield, catwoman) returns a Cat named
"GarfieldCatwoman" with age 0
```

#### 5. Adoption

Write a method called `adoption` that takes 1 Cat and 1 Person as
a paramater and sets the Cat's owner to be the Person.

```
ex: Person jon = Person('Jon');
    adoption(garfield, jon); // Jon is now Garfield's owner!
```

*Hint: this method does not return anything!*

**Bonus Challenge**

If the Cat's name is `Catwoman`, don't set the owner,
 but instead print: "Catwoman will never be anyone's pet!"

#### 6. isFree

Write a method called `isFree` that checks whether or not a Cat has an
owner.

```
ex: isFree(garfield) returns false
```

#### 7. isSibling

Write a method called `isSibling` that checks whether or not 2 Cats have the same owner.
